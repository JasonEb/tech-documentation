For this article, Iâ€™d like to demonstrate adapting `Class`-based React Components to `Function` components. The reading requires an intermediate understanding of building with React and the Redux process. I'll be providing an example codebase as well - feel free to clone the repository and interact with the code alongside the article. 

Function Components were [introduced in 2018](youtube.com), with a new paradigm that moved away from Component Lifecycles to managing component state and behavior with React Hooks. 

Component Lifecycles were widely adopted and became a huge part of the React paradigm. The Lifecycle methods main functionality are to trigger callbacks and side effects, such as fetching data or changing state. These methods also came in a variety of trigger points that requires a deeper understanding of React rendering and local state management. Although they are rich, a newer methodology has rise with React Hooks. 

```javascript
const () = > {  console.log("test"}
```
