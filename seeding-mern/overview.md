#  Description
Article about setting up a seeds file that generate dummy data using faker.js. This will go a  step further with mongoose, and demonstrating generating nested or related data. 

## Technologies
- [] Node.js
    - await/async
- [] Mongodb
    - [] Mongo Atlas
    - [] Mongoose ODM
- [] Faker.js 

## Should...
- [] establish tools used
- [] developer level
- [] data modeling
    - [] Users -> Posts

## Purpose
- article sets up future article with MERN stack
- for other developers looking to setup with mongoatlas
- EXACTLY for nested reference approaches.
    - why use nested references?
    - compare subdocuments approach 

## Goals
- [ ] Demonstrate related objects seeding with mongodb
- [ ] demonstrate the idea of keys, potentially a discriminator
- [ ] examine async behavior with interacting with the mongodb
- [ ] demonstrate setting up mongoatlas
- [ ] demonstrate inserting with nested references
